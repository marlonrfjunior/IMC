iOS app built by following the tutorial IOS &amp; Swift - the complete iOS-13 App development bootcamp on Udemy.
In this module, i created a Body Mass Index calculator App. Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether if they have eaten too many  or if they need to eat more.

I could learned in the module:

 - How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
 - Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
 - How to create classes and difference between classes and structs.
 - Pass by value vs. pass by reference.
 - Formatting Strings.
 - Color literals.
